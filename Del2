Good Approach: Explanatory Comments

Explanation of the Good Approach:
 * Docstring: Provides a clear overview of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
 * Inline Comment: Used sparingly to explain a specific, non-obvious calculation or logic.
 * Descriptive Variable Names: Make the code more readable without excessive comments.
 * Clear Function and Variable Naming: Choose names that accurately reflect their purpose.
Additional Tips for Effective Commenting:
 * Avoid Redundant Comments: Don't repeat what the code already says clearly.
 * Use Clear and Concise Language: Write comments in plain English, avoiding jargon.
 * Update Comments as Code Changes: Ensure comments always accurately reflect the code.
 * Use Consistent Formatting: Maintain a consistent style for comments.
 * Consider Your Audience: Tailor comments to the specific reader (e.g., other developers, future self).
By following these guidelines, you can write code that is not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain.
